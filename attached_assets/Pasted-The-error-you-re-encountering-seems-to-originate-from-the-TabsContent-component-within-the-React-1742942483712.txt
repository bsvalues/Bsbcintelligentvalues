The error you're encountering seems to originate from the `<TabsContent>` component within the React application. Here's a breakdown of the issue:

### Explanation of the Error
- **Cause**: The error message indicates that something unexpected occurred while rendering the `<TabsContent>` component. The stack trace highlights where the issue might have happened, including potential interactions with child components like `_c5` and `DataLoadingState`.
- **Context**: The error suggests a problem with how the `<TabsContent>` component is handling state, props, or child elements. It might involve missing data, improper handling of async operations, or invalid logic inside the component itself.

### Potential Causes
1. **Undefined or Null Data**: The component might rely on props or state values that are not properly initialized. For example, if certain data is `undefined`, it could cause rendering to fail.
2. **Uncaught Exception**: Any logic inside the component or its children that throws an exception would trigger this error.
3. **Library Mismatch**: The error also references the `@radix-ui/react-tabs` library, suggesting that it might be related to its usage. Incompatible versions or incorrect configuration could be a factor.

### Suggested Fixes
1. **Add an Error Boundary**: As the error message itself suggests, implementing an error boundary can help gracefully handle such errors. Hereâ€™s an example:
   ```jsx
   import React from "react";

   class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
       constructor(props) {
           super(props);
           this.state = { hasError: false };
       }

       static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
           return { hasError: true };
       }

       componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
           console.error("Error captured by boundary:", error, errorInfo);
       }

       render() {
           if (this.state.hasError) {
               return <div>Something went wrong. Please try again later.</div>;
           }

           return this.props.children;
       }
   }

   export default ErrorBoundary;
   ```

2. **Debug the Component**:
   - Look into the `<TabsContent>` component and verify that all necessary props are being passed and have valid values.
   - Check for any potential asynchronous operations that might not have resolved before rendering.

3. **Validate Data**:
   - Ensure that data being passed to the component is not `undefined` or `null`.
   - Example:
     ```jsx
     if (!data) {
         return <div>Loading...</div>;
     }
     ```

4. **Check Library Configuration**:
   - Verify that the `@radix-ui/react-tabs` library is up to date and compatible with your application.

5. **Wrap with Suspense for Async Issues**:
   - If the issue is related to asynchronous data loading, consider wrapping the component with `React.Suspense`:
     ```jsx
     <React.Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
         <TabsContent />
     </React.Suspense>
     ```
